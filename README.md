# Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn basic syntax for Kotlin. It is a program that I originally wrote in Python but wanted to incorporate Kotlin and classes with. Described simply, it is a calendar program that displays a specific month for a specific year in the gregorian calendar. The reason I chose Kotlin is because I wanted to start, eventually, learning more about mobile apps and the code that goes into them.

The Software gathers input from the user (month and year) and then uses those inputs to compute what day of the week the month begins and then format said month to the appropriate amount of days. It utilizes variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

My purpose in writing this was to simply take methods that I have learned in Python and then learn how they are implemented in Kotlin. I hope to utilize Kotlin in the future and this project granted me a basic understanding of how to use the syntax but also how to set up the intellij IDEA for future projects.

# Development Environment

Intellij IDEA app  

Commercial JDK for the setup

Kotlin language built into the intellij IDE.
# Useful Websites

* [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Kotlin Classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-class-and-objects/)

# Future Work

* GUI - as I gain experience with mobile apps and GUIs I would like to implement one for this project. 
* Daily Planning - I think that eventually being able to implement a daily planner would be a worthwhile challenge.
* More classes for the other functions in the project.
